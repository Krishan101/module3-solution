                “Health is Wealth” is a common and very famous saying that intents to specify how important health is for humans. “Health” in context to human means a state of human body which is free from any illness or injury. A healthy body and mind is an invaluable asset that one can have. If one is not healthy, then wealth is of no importance. If one is healthy, he or she can always work on to get wealth, however wealth without good health is worthless. Good Health brings us happiness, pleasure and wellbeing. Thus one should always work towards being healthy and adopt healthy lifestyle.
Health is wealth. There is nothing in our life that is more valuable than good health. Without health there is no happiness, no peace and no success. A person with bad health cannot enjoy the pleasure of being wealthy.

It is health that is real wealth. Quote by Mahatma Gandhi

Health is more valuable than money. Money cannot buy health and happiness. But a healthy person remains in a state of bliss and happiness.

A healthy person is completely free from any illness or injury. A person with sound health enjoys a stable health that also includes a healthy mental condition. Our health depends upon several factors, such as food, pollution, sleeping habits, mental condition, air, water and sunlight. Morning walks and Physical exercises are very helpful for the fitness of our mind and body. We should take proper care of our health so that we can enjoy our life completely.

Health is Wealth. When we are ill or we do not want to play or work, our bad health robs us of sound sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for one, who is constantly ailing. Life has little charm for him. He feels tired of life, always complaining about one thing or the other.

On the other hand, one with good health enjoys his life. When he works or plays he is never tired. A healthy person enjoys good food and sound sleep. For him the world is beautiful and life is all joy.

A healthy person sings the glory of life and works hard to realize his dreams. He never complains. He is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work very hard to earn his living, but even the richest man would envy him for his good health.You can follow any responses to this entry through the rss 20 feed.
